# Data & Models II

Repository for all problem sets in **RAIK 370H** at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

## Environment Set Up 
All code is written in `Python 3.5.3`, so make sure your Python version is higher than `2.7`. I would suggest using `pip` to install all packages used throughout the repository. To prevent pip from globally installing all dependencies, you should create a virtual environment (probably using `virtualenv`), activiate it with the following command: `source bin/activate`. You can later deactivate it with the `deactivate` command. Make sure you're in the top level of the repository once `pip` is installed and your virtual environment is activated. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and `pip` will recursively install all dependencies.
